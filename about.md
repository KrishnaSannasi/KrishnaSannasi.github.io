This blog is about the Rust Programming Language. Here we will delve into the details of how Rust operates, how it desugars various constructs, and more! This blog will assume that you have read [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

I am `RustyYato`, and I am active on
* [Rust Users](https://users.rust-lang.org/u/RustyYato/summary)
* [Rust Internals](https://internals.rust-lang.org/u/RustyYato/summary)
* [Github](https://github.com/RustyYato)
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/YatoRust)

These blog posts will be posted to the Rust Users Forum and Reddit whenever I make something new.

I have created a number of crates including:
 * [`generic-field-projection`](https://github.com/RustyYato/generic-field-projection) - A prototype implementation for [RFC #2708](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2708), which allows you overload the dot operator to get field access on arbitrary types.
    * [`ptr-to-field`](https://github.com/RustyYato/ptr-to-field) was a precursor to `generic-field-projection`, and helped inform it's design decisions.
    * [`typsy`](https://github.com/RustyYato/typsy) - Type level list and enums which is used in the internals of `generic-field-projection`. This crate was heavily inspired by [`frunk`](https://crates.io/crates/frunk)
 * [`double-buffer`](https://github.com/RustyYato/double-buffer) - A reimplementation of [`left-right`](crates.io/crates/left-right) that has a few different design decisions, and serves as a lower level api to `left-right`
 * [`generic-vec`](https://github.com/RustyYato/generic-vec) â€“ a `Vec` implementation that is generic over its storage strategy
    * For example, it's possible to implement both a `Heap`-backed vector and an `Array` backed vector with this library, and use `Vec` without caring about how its data is stored
 * [`type-families`](https://github.com/RustyYato/type-families) - An implementation of some popular type-classes from `Haskell` in stable `Rust`
 * [`rel-ptr`](https://github.com/RustyYato/rel-ptr) - Relative pointers in Rust, which can be used to soundly create one class of self-referenential types.
 * [`vec-utils`](https://github.com/RustyYato/vec-utils) - Extra functions to effiencently covnert a `Vec<T>` to `Vec<U>`, reusing the memory where possible
 * [`set_slice`](https://github.com/RustyYato/published_crates/tree/master/set_slice) - My first crate, some syntactic sugar to allow setting arbitrary sub-slices of a slice

I've also work on a number of open source projects, chief among them:
* Rust `std` library [`link`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/56796) - where I modified the blanket implementations on `From -> TryFrom` to `Into -> TryFrom`
* Found a number of Internal Compiler Errors (`ICE`) in Rust - [`link`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=+is%3Aissue+label%3AI-ICE+author%3ARustyYato+)
* MIRI deallocation hooks [`link 1`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/56796), [`link 2`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70962) - where I added deallocation hooks to MIRI, which shows you when an allocation is deallcoated when it is tracked.
* Made [`once_cell`](https://github.com/matklad/once_cell) more flexible [`link`](https://github.com/matklad/once_cell/pull/37) - Changed `once_cell::*::Lazy` to allow `FnOnce` closures instead of just `Fn` closures
   * `once_cell` is now in the process of getting merged into std, which is exciting
* Exposed useful traits in [`packed_simd`](https://github.com/rust-lang/packed_simd) [`link`](https://github.com/rust-lang/packed_simd/pull/259)
* Found soundness holes in multiple crates:
   * in [`dashmap`](https://github.com/xacrimon/dashmap) - [soundness hole](https://github.com/xacrimon/dashmap/issues/10)
   * in [`evmap`](https://github.com/jonhoo/left-right) - [soundness hole](https://github.com/jonhoo/left-right/issues/75)
   * in [`stowaway`](https://github.com/Lucretiel/stowaway/) - [soundness hole](https://github.com/Lucretiel/stowaway/issues/8)
