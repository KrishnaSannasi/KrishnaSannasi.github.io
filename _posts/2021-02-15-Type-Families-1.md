Do you want to use Higher Kinded Types (`HKT`) in Rust? Are you tired of waiting for `GAT`? Well, this is the place to be.

It's easiest to understand `HKT` by analogy. In programming we have many different tiers of abstractions. Starting at the bottom we have `term`s (aka values) like `0`, `true`, `"hello world!"`. If we want to work with a lot of `term`s that share a property, we use `type`s. For example, if we want to work with ...

* 32-bit integer, we use `i32`
* utf-8 strings, we use `&str` or `String`

We generally use snake case to refer to `term`s generically like `x`, `im_an_integer`, and `database_connection`. We use functions to operate on these generic values.

```rust
fn add_one(
    // a generic 32-bit integer
    x: i32
) -> i32 { x + 1 }
```

Moving up the abstraction tiers, we come to `type`s. For example: `String`, `i32`, or `bool`. If we want to work with a lot of `type`s that share a property, we use `trait`s and generics. For example, if we want to work with ...

* types that can be debug printed, we use `std::fmt::Debug`
* types that can be iterated, we use `Iterator`

We generally use pascal case to refer to `types`s generically like `T`, `Self`, and `This`. We use generic functions to work with these generic types.

```rust
fn print<T: Debug>(x: T) {
    println!("{:?}", x);
}
```

Moving up the abstraction tiers again, we come to `kind`s. For example: `Option`, `Result`, or `Vec`. Wait what. Let's take a step back. Before I mentioned that `String`, `i32`, and `bool` are types. We also have more types that we can use, generic types like `Option<i32>` or `Result<String, String>`. What if you want to generalize over these types? Something of the form `T<U>`. That's where we get to kinds. For example:

* `i32` has the kind `Type`
* `Option<i32>` has the kind `Type`
* `'a` has the kind `Lifetime`
* `Option` has the kind `Type -> Type`
    * W H A T, let's stop and explain what's going on here

Generic types can be represented as a function from kinds to kinds. For example, `Option` is a function that takes a `Type` and produces a `Type` (hence `Type -> Type`). Let's see some more examples:

* `Result` has the kind `Type -> Type -> Type`
    * I'll use this notation because that's how it's done in the literature
    * Note: this is equivalent to `(Type, Type) -> Type` (you can always transform a function that take a tuple of arguments into one that takes multiple arguments, and vice versa)
* references have a kind `Lifetime -> Type -> Type`
    * `&'a T`, one lifetime and one type parameter :)
* arrays have the kind `Type -> usize -> Type`
    * `[T; len]`, one type and one `usize` `term` (getting close to dependent types, something we won't touch in this post)

With this notion of `kind`s we are now well equipped to generalize over generics. Just one cinch, `Rust` doesn't know about `kind`s! So how do we generalize over generics if we can't even express the fundamental building blocks.

# Type Families

The key insight is that we can represent `kind`s as a system of types and traits. For example, here's how to handle `Type -> Type` kinds.

Note: I'll show how `Option` fits in, and introduce `Result<_, E>`, but I'll leave the implementation of `Vec` to you. It's an interesting puzzle if you are inclined

```rust
// `Option` has the kind `Type -> Type`,
// we'll represent it with `OptionFamily`
struct OptionFamily;
// `Result` has the kind `Type -> Type -> Type`,
// so we fill in one of the types with a concrete one
struct ResultFamily<E>(PhantomData<E>);

// I'll leave the implementation of `VecFamily` to you

// This trait represents the `kind` `Type -> Type`
pub trait OneTypeParam<A> {
    // This represents the output of the function `Type -> Type`
    // for a specific argument `A`.
    type This;
}

impl<A> OneTypeParam<A> for OptionFamily {
    // `OptionFamily` represents `Type -> Type`,
    // so filling in the first argument means
    // `Option<A>`
    type This = Option<A>;
}

impl<A, E> OneTypeParam<A> for ResultFamily<E> {
    // note how all results in this family have `E` as the error type
    // This is similar to how currying works in functional languages
    type This = Result<A, E>;
}
```

Note how a `trait` can act as a function over types, so you can encode the idea `Type -> Type` using a trait!

Let's also introduce a type alias for ease of use. 

```rust
// Option<A> == This<OptionFamily, A>
pub type This<T, A> = <T as OneTypeParam<A>>::This;
```

Now we can replace all usage of `Option`, `Result<_, E>` with `OptionFamily` or `ResultFamily<E>`! From this we can build up abstractions that "require" HKT. Let's start with the simplest abstraction `Functor`. This is just any `Type -> Type` that has a notion of mapping a value. Generally `Functor` represents a collection, but it can do much more than that (But I won't dive into `Functor` in particular in this post).

```rust
trait Functor<A, B>: OneTypeParam<A> + OneTypeParam<B> {
    fn map<F>(self, this: This<Self, A>, f: F) -> This<Self, B>
    where
        F: Fn(A) -> B + Copy;
}
```

This is quite a lot, so let's soak it in.

```rust
OneTypeParam<A> + OneTypeParam<B>
```

First, we require that our families can be used with either type. This allows you to restrict the families in some ways, for example for `HashSet`, only allow `T: Hash + Eq`. `A` will be the input type, and `B` will be the output type.

```rust
fn map<F>(self, this: This<Self, A>, f: F) -> This<Self, B>
where
    F: Fn(A) -> B + Copy;
```

Next we have this monstrous function! This will be easier to explain if we have a concrete family.

```rust
/// for `OptionFamily`
fn map<F>(self, this: Option<A>, f: F) -> Option<B>
where
    F: Fn(A) -> B + Copy;
```

So this is just the same as the ordinary map in `Option`, except it requires `Fn`, instead of `FnOnce`. We could generalize over `Fn` and `FnOnce` if Rust had associated traits, but alas we don't, so we'll have to make do with `Fn` (I'll leave it to you to figure out a nice way to abstract over `Fn`, `FnMut` and `FnOnce`). All we've done is generalize it to *any* family, not just `Option`.

The `Copy` bound is nice for things like `Vec` where you need to apply the function multiple times. You can convert any `Fn` to a `Fn + Copy` because `&_` implement `Fn` and are `Copy`.

So all together again:

```rust
trait Functor<A, B>: OneTypeParam<A> + OneTypeParam<B> {
    fn map<F>(self, this: This<Self, A>, f: F) -> This<Self, B>
    where
        F: Fn(A) -> B + Copy;
}
```

`Functor` just specifies a mapping operation. We can implement this rather easily.

```rust
impl<A, B> Functor<A, B> for OptionFamily {
    fn map<F>(self, this: This<Self, A>, f: F) -> This<Self, B>
    where
        F: Fn(A) -> B + Copy {
        // I'm not cheating!
        this.map(f)
    }
}

// try out `VecFamily`, it doesn't need to be optimal, it just needs to work!
```

Ok, but that's boring, I hear you say. What about `Monad`? Typically it's defined by it's `bind` operation (We'll skip `Applicative` here, try it out yourself!). I'm not going to explain how `Monad` works, or why you would want it, just how to implement it.

```rust
trait Monad<A, B>: Functor<A, B> {
    fn bind<F>(self, a: This<Self, A>, f: F) -> This<Self, B>
    where
        F: Fn(A) -> This<Self, B> + Copy;
}
```

Looks the same as `Functor` to me! ... Wait, the bound on `F` looks funky. Let's dig in to the `OptionFamily` implementation again, maybe that will clear things up.

```rust
/// for `OptionFamily`
fn bind<F>(self, a: Option<A>, f: F) -> Option<B>
where
    F: Fn(A) -> Option<B> + Copy;
```

This looks very familiar, ... where have I seen this before? `Option::and_then` is that you?

```rust
impl<A, B> Monad<A, B> for OptionFamily {
    fn bind<F>(self, this: This<Self, A>, f: F) -> This<Self, B>
    where
        F: Fn(A) -> This<Self, B> + Copy {
        // It fits ðŸ˜‰
        this.and_then(f)
    }
}

// try out `VecFamily`, it doesn't need to be optimal, it just needs to work!
```

In this way you can implement most, if not all `HKT` abstractions in stable Rust. However the ergonomics of these abstractions are downright abysmal. Bounds, bounds, bounds *everywhere*. We saw this a little in `Functor<A, B>`, we needed `OneTypeParam<A> + OneTypeParam<B>` (why does family need to be repeated!). Hopefully we can solve this on nightly, find out in Part 2! Before we get there though, I need to explain why this transformation works in more detail, which will be the subject of [Part 1.5](../15/Type-Families-1_5.html) ...
